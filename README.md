# Test_task
this program fills 2 containers (vector and map) with random numbers. Next, no more than 15 random elements are removed. After that, the containers are synchronized (in vector and map (the key values are synchronized in the map(the keys remain unchanged)) only the existing elements in both containers remain (duplicates are not deleted)).
